# Six-frame_translation_mapping
This repository features code for six-frame translation from NCBI genome fasta files, mapping peptide IDs to genomic location, and matching peptide IDs to canonically and non-canonical sites.

To begin this workflow:
1. Download a genome fasta file from NCBI.
2. Download a protein sequence fasta file from NCBI.
3. Collect MS data on the organism of interest.
4. Navigate here (https://hickslab.github.io/Six-frame_translation_mapping/) to start the tutorial.
